# SecureFileManagement
 
### About the Project

In today’s digital world, keeping sensitive data safe is more important than ever. Cyber threats like data breaches, malware attacks, and identity theft are getting more sophisticated, putting both individuals and businesses at risk. That’s where our project comes in—it’s designed to create a highly secure system that protects data through strong authentication, secure file management, and proactive threat detection.
At its core, this system is built with a multi-layered security approach to ensure data remains confidential, intact, and accessible only to authorized users. It starts with robust authentication mechanisms—users register with password hashing, log in securely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and benefit from an extra layer of protection with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Additionally, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that only those with the right permissions can access certain files or features, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
